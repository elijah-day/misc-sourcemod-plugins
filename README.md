# Miscellaneous SourceMod Plugins

###### Copyright (C) 2024 Elijah Day

### About

Some old SourceMod plugins for a, now defunct, Team Fortress 2 server.  The
repository may be updated if I decide to host any servers using SourceMod in the
future.  Though, there aren't any plans to do so at the moment.

### Credits

Thank you to the SourceMod team for providing their incredibily fun and
easy-to-use game mod.  You can find their website
[here](https://www.sourcemod.net/).
